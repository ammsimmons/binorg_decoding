# binorg_decoding
Bin-Organized Decoding (J. Neuro: Bae&amp;Luck, 2018). 

Here you will find an updated version of Bae & Luck (2018) analysis scripts.  We have updated the scripts to allow the use of bin-organized decoding, therefore allowing users to use EEGlab/ERPlab* to format and decode their own data more seamlessly. 

**ERPLAB Version V8.01 REQUIRED** 
Download ERPLAB here: https://github.com/lucklab/erplab/releases/download/8.01/erplab8.01.zip

**Decoding Scripts** 
The MATLAB scripts used for the online webinar are found in this .zip file: https://github.com/ammsimmons/binorg_decoding/archive/master.zip

Order of Operations:
1. Decoding_binOrg.m
2. SVM_ECOC_ERP_Decoding_2020.m
	--See Below for Link to Data on Box:

3. SVM_ECOC_Stat_Plot_Permutation_2020.m 
4. SVM_ECOC_ERP_PermutationTesting_2020.m

Background: 
The scripts we use are an updated version of those found in Bae & Luck (2018). If you wish to see those on OSF, see them on this link https://osf.io/bpexa/ 
Our scripts above are much simpler to use for your own data than these original 2018 scripts.
